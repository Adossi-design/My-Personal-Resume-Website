    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Adossi Fred William, a first-year Software Engineering student at African Leadership University (ALU). 
      Passionate about leveraging technology to address real-world challenges, I have a particular interest in transforming 
      the agricultural sector. Growing up in Chad, where agriculture plays a crucial role in the economy, 
      I gained hands-on experience working on my father's farm during holidays. This experience instilled in me the value 
      of hard work, innovation, and sustainable practices.

      <p>
        As a software engineering student, my goal is to bridge the gap between technology and agriculture. I aim to develop 
        innovative solutions that empower my community, improve access to agricultural products, and contribute to 
        poverty reduction. By combining my technical skills with my farming background, I hope to create impactful and sustainable change.

    <h2>Farming Experience</h2>
    <p>

      <ul>
      <li><h3>Online Agriculture Marketplace</h3></li>
      <p>
        I'm working on a website that allows people to directly order agricultural products online. 
        My long-term plan is to farm and sell my own products through this platform, making it easier 
        for people in my community to access fresh produce.
      </p>
      <li><h3>Training people in my community</h3></li>
      <p>I aim to provide training on the proper use and maintenance of agricultural tools to help local 
        farmers improve productivity and efficiency. By teaching them how to maximize the potential of their
        tools, we can enhance crop yields and reduce wasted resources. Additionally, I plan to raise awareness
        about the crucial role of farming in supporting livelihoods and combating poverty. Promoting sustainable 
        and innovative farming practices will help ensure long-term food security and economic growth in the 
        region, empowering farmers to contribute more effectively to the community's development.</p>
